  ## Description
  This project builds off starter code to configure a backend application which uses "Express" to create a server that handles the database queries and "Sequelize" to interact with the database to produce the data for queries.
  This E-commerce backend application creates, deletes, updates, and reads products, categories, and tags to mimic the functionality of a professional e-commerce application.
